# Part II of the Final Project: Kyle Soto

# Follow up Thoughts on Part I
In Part I of this project I focused on trying to tell the story of what it means to be homeless in America and the myriad of ways homelessness decreases quality of life. In doing so though I didn't establish a story so much as a collection of interesting data. After receiving feedback from a few potential readers it was clear that the lack of narrative structure was a problem I needed to solve and that the scope of the intial topic was simply too large to tackle in this time frame in a cohesive story arc. In Part II I wanted to spend more time focusing on creating a narrative arc, and narrowing in on a specific area of the topic of homelessness. Following user testing it seemed that users were most intrigued by the surrounding housing and the shocking number of homeless that are undercounted. This in mind in part II i focused on telling the story of homelessness from teh perspective of housing, and how homelessness is broader than one might initially realize.
