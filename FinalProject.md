# Part II of the Final Project: Kyle Soto

# Follow up Thoughts on Part I
In Part I of this project I focused on trying to tell the story of what it means to be homeless in America and the myriad of ways homelessness decreases quality of life. In doing so though I didn't establish a story so much as a collection of interesting data. After receiving feedback from a few potential readers it was clear that the lack of narrative structure was a problem I needed to solve and that the scope of the intial topic was simply too large to tackle in this time frame in a cohesive story arc. In Part II I wanted to spend more time focusing on creating a narrative arc, and narrowing in on a specific area of the topic of homelessness. Following user testing it seemed that users were most intrigued by the surrounding housing and the shocking number of homeless that are undercounted. This in mind in part II i focused on telling the story of homelessness from teh perspective of housing, and how homelessness is broader than one might initially realize.

# User Research

## Deciding on a Target Audience and Choosing Test Subjects
Since homelessness is an issue that is well known but poorly understood I struggled to decide on picking one audience. In the end I decided the unifying aspect of my audience was that they are people who have only some context on homelessness as I was before I started this project, and who are interested in issues of equity , whether they be in policy positions, arts positions, or none of the above. This gave me a broad sample of test subjects so I chose a friend who is a journalist , and a couple of my former work colleagues who are user experience designers. These are people who I trust not just personally, but for their understanding of narrative structure and thoughtful design.My subjects ranged in age from 25 - 62.

## Interview Structure and Logistics 
I wanted to represent this on a both a platform you use a mouse on and a touchscreen. To do this I created images of my wireframes and had them scroll through them as they read information. The first time I provided only a very brief context on what the class I was taking was and that this was a data visualization based project. I did not tell them the topic or my focus as I manner to see if I was creating a discernable story arc that could be followed logically. After the initial scroll through I asked the user a few questions and logged the feedback. I asked them to then a second time go through the wireframes, this time with the knowledge from the first run through and to see what follow up questions they had, what aspects they found interesting, if any issues of understanding were present, and if their perspective was any different from before they saw this story.

## Questions and their Stated Objectives

Question:
What do you think this project is about?   

Objective:
Does the user understand the general narrative flow? Is the point clear and well defined?

Question:
Do you feel the visualizations you saw supported the assertions made? If so were they persuasive?

Objective: 
Does the story have a clear thesis, and is that thesis a compelling one? What aspects of the story are most effective?

Question: 
Is there any data you felt needed clarification or context?

Objective:
Is the data clear and easily understood are the charts laid out effectively?

Question:
How did you feel after seeing this?

Objective:
Is this data accomplising its goals of both informing and spurring action?


## Interview Script

I kept 3 files open, the png of the wireframes, tableau public for my data visualizations, and my ARCGIS Pro for viewing the maps.

"Hi, thank you so much for agreeing to sit down with me and review this project. I have some wireframes of a project for a course I'm taking this fall. As wireframes there may be items that appear clickable and may not, there may be some small spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. If you see anyn feel free to let me know. First I'm going to ask you to review these wireframes without offering too much information. If you are confused or have any questions feel free to ask at any time. Graphs that look like images likely have clickable versions, if you would like to see them just say so and I will move you to the tab they're open in. I'm going to ask you a few questions at the end about your experience, please be as open and honest as possible. I want to recieve any feedback you have."

Users were generally split on seeing live working versions of data visualizations. A larger number were interested in interacting with the GIS maps. 


## Collected Comments from Intital Pass Through
I collected comments that were interesting, insightful, or spur of the moment. I've recorded some below.

"It may be nice to see the 1 in 7 in addition to the 1 in 588, it would make clearer that the square is of 588"

"The wavy pattern is like woaahhh, maybe put the red altogether?"

"Ooh wow, this is interesting" (referring to the population proportion of homeless versus American population)

"The second map looks cool, but it seems like it's making the same point as the first one"

"I love data, but this may actually be too many graphs"

"I'd like to see more of the people with less that 50% rent and more than 30%, how many people are in between?

"I love the little dollars they're so cute"


## Findings
While there was mostly positive response to the project. I did receive some feedback to incorporate into the final draft. The largest improvement seemed to be the story arc which most users felt was clear and stated. The visualizations were considered appropriate and they made a persuasive case but there were comments on the number of them and how much some added to the thesis. I've sorted feedback into 3 categories to review. Design, Data, and Narrative Arc.

##1. Design
Users picked up on an inconsistent palate and style of visualizations, they mentioned that some looked like items from multiple sources and that a coherent "brand" may be a more effective approach. One mentioned the use of color as being too heavy handed and wanted to see less color and greater stylistic consistency. Users were inconsistent about the charting approach with mostly positive feedback on the dollar chart. The red wave like structure in the more accurate reflection of homelessness confused some users.

"Were these all made together?"

"I think there are just too many colors"

"There's so many charts"

##2. Data
The data was effective in conveying the scope and seriosuness of homelessness and in the widespread nature of the danger from it. Not all charts were equally effective with some charts not providing enougn new information. the second map in particular was divisive among users. The rent and living stadard index didn't seem to have much effect and users didn't seem to really know what the number around rent index meant. Users also mentioned wanting to see a smaller 1 in 7 estimate alongside the version of real homelessness with the 588 person sample.

"120 out of what?"

"I feel like this chart is making the same point as the one above, just more"

"I'd like to see the 1 in 7 up close"

##3. Narrative Arc
The story was the most effective portion of the project. Users responded positively to the arc of the story, with a number saying they felt like they had learned something or would want ton discuss the issue further. The most apparent piece of feedback was that the call of action felt "tacked on" and that they would like to know other manners of involvement and what organizations to support more directly. A number mentioned looking for guidance after learning this new information about homelessness on where and how to act.

"I want to know what organizations specifically I should get involved with"
