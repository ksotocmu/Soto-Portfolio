# Part II of the Final Project: Kyle Soto

# Follow up Thoughts on Part I
In Part I of this project I focused on trying to tell the story of what it means to be homeless in America and the myriad of ways homelessness decreases quality of life. In doing so though I didn't establish a story so much as a collection of interesting data. After receiving feedback from a few potential readers it was clear that the lack of narrative structure was a problem I needed to solve and that the scope of the intial topic was simply too large to tackle in this time frame in a cohesive story arc. In Part II I wanted to spend more time focusing on creating a narrative arc, and narrowing in on a specific area of the topic of homelessness. Following user testing it seemed that users were most intrigued by the surrounding housing and the shocking number of homeless that are undercounted. This in mind in part II i focused on telling the story of homelessness from teh perspective of housing, and how homelessness is broader than one might initially realize.

# User Research

## Deciding on a Target Audience and Choosing Test Subjects
Since homelessness is an issue that is well known but poorly understood I struggled to decide on picking one audience. In the end I decided the unifying aspect of my audience was that they are people who have only some context on homelessness as I was before I started this project, and who are interested in issues of equity , whether they be in policy positions, arts positions, or none of the above. This gave me a broad sample of test subjects so I chose a friend who is a journalist , and a couple of my former work colleagues who are user experience designers. These are people who I trust not just personally, but for their understanding of narrative structure and thoughtful design.My subjects ranged in age from 25 - 62.

## Interview Structure and Logistics 
I wanted to represent this on a both a platform you use a mouse on and a touchscreen. To do this I created images of my wireframes and had them scroll through them as they read information. The first time I provided only a very brief context on what the class I was taking was and that this was a data visualization based project. I did not tell them the topic or my focus as I manner to see if I was creating a discernable story arc that could be followed logically. After the initial scroll through I asked the user a few questions and logged the feedback. I asked them to then a second time go through the wireframes, this time with the knowledge from the first run through and to see what follow up questions they had, what aspects they found interesting, if any issues of understanding were present, and if their perspective was any different from before they saw this story.
