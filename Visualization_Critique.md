### Step One: Find a Data Visualization 

When selecting a data visualization I wanted to choose one that was something you might see in an everyday scenario, and not just a curated bad data visualization, so I found one in
the wild. As I was reading Bloomberg News I came across a visualization about the changing labor market that compared unemployment rates and month to month changes in average hourly
wage. To reporduce the data I downloaded the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment numbers and numbers on average hourly wage change from month to month for the same time period.
