# Part III of the Final Project: Kyle Soto

# Initial Ideas and Forming a Story.
When I initially started this projectI knew I wanted to cover the issue of homelessness, and as I dove into further research I found there was an abundance of issues surrounding
homelessness all of which would be deserving of their own story. Initially my idea was to provide a summary of homelessness and what it meant to be homeless as well as trying 
to change some perceptions around the issue. Even that proved to be a gargantuan task. I spent a minimum of fiften hours on just the research phase of this project and was still 
finding tons of data to discuss. My fear was I wouldn't do justice to the issue and would only tell a partial narrative which I was concerned could be more reductive than helpful. I approached my initial draft with this idea in mind and laid out a sort of sampler of data surrounding homelessness, but failed to tell a cohesive story. This is in large part due to the fact that I myself didn't have a strong sense of the story I wanted to tell or how to bring it back to a reasonable size. The statistic that I found most compelling, and the one that others seemed to be most drawn in was the gross underestimation of the scale of homelessness. HUD data was very limited on the issue and even HUD approached their own data with caution speculating it was an underestimate of the true number of homeless. I found the study by Bruce Link estimating homelessness at 7% and near homelessness (doubling up) at 14% of the population which seems astonomically high. I was hesitant at first and approached the data with a fair bit of caution but repeated attempts to debunk those numbers only further verified them not just in the United States but internationally as well. Investigating this I thought about NYC and coincidentally had recently learned in my GIS class how to work with Census tracts so I downloaded data and the results on rent burden were hard to believe and from there I had my story.


# Building a Narrative in Part II
The second part of this project was critical for me in figuring out how to craft a narrative around what I wanted to say. I had a better understanding of what I wanted to say and how I wanted to bring the distance between the perception people have of homeless people and the reality closer together, but the details of how to appraoch it were still a bit fuzzy. The draft in Part II unfolded similarly to how I happened to discover the narrative through my own investigation, so the focus was to take the reader on the journey with me and have them learn the information as I did through a series of questions that build on one another. I had a lot of data and was still not sure what to show so I built a number of GIS maps, tableau dashboards, and sketched visualizations and asked people around me which they found most effective. In Part 2 I aired on the side of including too much data and through user research found some of charts were potentially redundant. The consistent mention of it lacking a visual brand also was concerning as I wanted to story not to just to convey the information but also have an emotional resonance much of which is accomplished with effective visuals. The feedback in user research was helpful in short of sharpening the tip of what I wanted to say and cutting it down to the most imporant points. I simply ran out of time to incorporate the feedback in Part II into my wireframes so I kept notes of what was said and utilized those ideas in my Part III.


# Telling the Story and Establishing the Feel
By Part III I had a strong sense of the story, I knew what I wanted to say and for the most part how I wanted to say it, so the focus was instead on the core logistics of building the narrative effectively. A lot of the story on homelessness is housing and wealth statistics which can be dry if not framed properly so my most pertinent task was to bring those statistics to life and give life to the information. This in mind I spent a lot of time thinking about and testing out different photos, videos and layouts. None of the layouts on ARC GIS Storymaps seemed to work properly and since Part II I had trimmed many of the maps I started with so I had to scrap my initial idea of working in Storymaps in favor of Shorthand which had more features I liked and gave more options for adding charts and imagery. Large pops of color felt inappropriate for the subject matter so I initially wanted to stick to darker colors but on further investigation I found using mostly black and white images was more effective and conveyed the sense of being forgotten which was part of the idea I wanted to get across that there is this population of people society seems to have forgotten or disassociated from that are struggling, and that this population is when accounted for honestly and anonymously larger than most single states in the United States. Presenting this in mind I cut a number of visualizations to make my story a little leaner, and tried to really focus on the tie between homelessness, rent, and income inequality and the human costs of such a significant transition of wealth from an already cash strapped population to the wealthiest 5% of Americans. Even I was shocked at just how well it mapped with 50% rent burden mapping cleanly to population of nearly homeless people identified in Bruce Link’s study. I made sure to population adjust the numbers so people reading could see how rising rents burden people and that correlates with more people potentially homeless. I made the decision to include the map of every census tract so if anyone was interested they could identify the risk in their own hometown and see the wide scope of the issue. 

# Final Thoughts
In the end I learned a significant amount not just about homelessness but about the importance of how to use data to tell a story. As an aspiring public sector data scientist this will be a large part of my job. Simply having the numbers to prove your point isn’t enough, you need to present your finding in such a way that it motivates people. The sheer volume and complexity of the issues confronting the public sector is more than any one person can digest, so its important to break issues down individually and motivate action on them, and through that action people will see the data themselves and the story will start to unravel, just as it did for me as I dug into the issue.
